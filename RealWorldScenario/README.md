# Real World Scenario

This directory contains files to demonstrate the real-world scenario
as presented in the COUGAR GECCO paper.

## File Explanations

`cluster_points_labeled_holdout-1_STR.csv` contains labelled output from
COUGAR, alongside string representation of the AVClass labels for usability.

`ExploreCOUGARData.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook demonstrating how section
4.4 was achieved, and includes the code to generate the appropriate stats
and figures. This was created in Google's Colaboratory, and is an excellent
environment in which to play with the data.
