# Statistical Significance

This directory contains files to conduct statistical significance tests
on COUGAR data as presented in the COUGAR GECCO paper.

## Usage

The workflow is to first call `extract_stats.py`, and then call `anova.py`
on the same directory. This will result in an `anova_results.txt` to be
generated in the passed directory.

For more detailed information on usage and folder structure, see the Python
scripts.
